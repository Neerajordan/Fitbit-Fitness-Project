# 1. Summary
The FitBit Fitness Tracker App analysis project involved examining data from 18 different sources, including daily activity, calories, hourly steps, etc., collected through a distributed survey. After cleaning and merging the datasets, the analysis focused on identifying trends in daily and hourly activity, minute-level patterns, sleep data, weight logs, and heart rate variations. Utilizing visualizations such as Pandas Profiling, histograms, and scatter plots, the project aimed to provide actionable insights for the marketing team, including potential app feature improvements and correlations between different metrics. The tools used included Python for data processing and visualization, with Pandas Profiling for comprehensive data exploration.

# 2. Ask Phase
2.1 Business Task

# 3. Prepare Phase
In the Prepare phase of the FitBit Fitness Tracker App analysis project, the focus was on setting the groundwork for robust data exploration and analysis. This phase involved:

Data Collection: Collected data from 18 different files, encompassing various aspects of FitBit app usage, through a distributed survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. These files included information on daily and hourly activity, calories, sleep, weight logs, and heart rate.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Conducted thorough data cleaning to address issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Merged relevant datasets to create a consolidated and comprehensive dataset for analysis. Extracted meaningful features from timestamp data to enhance the analysis.

Data Profiling: Leveraged Pandas Profiling to generate comprehensive data profiles, gaining insights into data distributions, correlations, and potential issues. This step helped in understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

Feature Engineering: Derived new features or transformed existing ones to enhance the dataset's informativeness for subsequent analysis. This included extracting relevant information from timestamps and creating aggregated metrics.

Data Validation: Ensured the integrity and consistency of the dataset through validation checks. Verified that the data aligned with the expected patterns and distributions, addressing any anomalies that could impact the analysis.

The Prepare phase laid a solid foundation, ensuring that the dataset was cleaned, organized, and enriched for the subsequent exploration and analysis stages. The goal was to set the stage for meaningful insights and actionable recommendations in the upcoming phases of the project.
